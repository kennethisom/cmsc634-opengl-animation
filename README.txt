To my knowledge, all required functionality is implemented as described in the project description.  There are three modes which can be switched between by pressing 'p'.  The first is one marker with the control points visible.  The second is only the moving marker.  And the third is the cloud of markers.

I created the fourth mode for the extra credit which displays the terrain from assignment 4, but did not finish the extra credit beyond that.
